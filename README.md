# Lamp-docker

This is a little Lamp stack with Docker. 


## The environment

Have a look at this folder. You have these files and folders :
- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile
- .env
- www
- conf

The `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` are the configurations file in order to run your containers. 

The `www` folder is your work environment folder where you will code your PHP files. There is already a `index.php` in it. 

The `conf` directory contains files to configure your Apache server (`apache.conf`, `vhost.conf`) or PHP (`php.ini`).

For working, you can paste this repo in your computer, rename it as you want and follow the instructions below. 


## Run `docker`üê≥

When starting your env for the first time, run the following command in your repo:

	docker-compose build
	
> **NOTE:** thus you don't need to run this command each time, it may be useful to *re*build your services when you change the configuration of your services.

Then, simply run the following command to get started:

    docker-compose up -d

The details for all your services is detailed bellow.
